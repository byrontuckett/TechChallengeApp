# Deployment

The following is a guide on deploying this application from the repository that has been cloned to your device.

## Pre-requisites

The following are requried to be install on the device to which you are deploying.

- Git
- An Azure Subscription
- Azure Cli
- Terraform
- Docker

Azure cloud shell has terraform and git pre-installed as well as authenticated to azure, making it a great way to quickly launch this deployment from a cloned copy of this repository. However to seed the database we will run a quick docker command which will launch a container, connect to PostreSQL and seed the database then will close.  
This task requires the docker engine is installed.

# Architecture

See the [Architecture documentation](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of what will be deployed.

# Instructions

Launch [Azure cloud shell](https://shell.azure.com)

> ...and ensure the desired subscription is selected!

Clone the repository

`git clone <repo-url>`

Next run through the [terraform variables file](./azure/variables.tf). There are some `sensible` defaults that you are welcome to override.

Change into the terrform deployment directory of **.deploy/azure**

```bash
terraform init

terraform plan -out tfplan

terraform apply tfplan
```

If the terraform output is Ok, proceed with the deployment.

\***\* Perform the following on the device where you have docker installed. \*\***

After the infrastructure is setup, create a file that will house some environment variables. An example of the key=value pairs are in **deploy/env.conf.example**. Fill with the values that are being used for the database user, password and host.

```bash
#pop out of the current 'azure' folder

cd ..

code env.conf
```

We will pass these values as environmental variables into our docker image, to seed the database. This is a once off task, and could be automated as a Stage in a pipeline but for now it would be quicker to perform this action.

!! _This is not a production methodology of deploying schema changes to a database. This is a development scenario_ !!

_Source_ the file into your bash environment to create Environmental variables. This is so that you don't have to type the variables inline.

```bash
# Add some environmental variables into our current shell environment
source env.conf

# echo out a variable to test
echo $VTT_DBHOST
```

As is the beauty of Docker, run this shortlived task to connect and seed the Database.

```bash

docker pull servian/techchallengeapp

docker run \
    -e VTT_DBUSER=$VTT_DBUSER \
    -e VTT_DBHOST=$VTT_DBHOST \
    -e VTT_DBNAME=$VTT_DBNAME \
    -e VTT_DBPASSWORD=$VTT_DBPASSWORD \
     servian/techchallengeapp \
     updatedb -s
```

You should expect to see positive logging from the application advising that the seed operation completed.

Visit the Application URL (terraform would have output this) and start GTD!

## Moving Forward

- Terraform remote state for continual state and team collaboration.
- Implementing Continous Deployment via Azure DevOps
- Authentication to Azure with a service principal
- Secrets via Key Vault, pulled into the pipelines as a variable group
- Connect the Web App to Azure database for PostreSQL with Private Link and remove the insecure firewall rule of allowing 0.0.0.0

## Terraform State file

_*Shamelessly ripped from julie.io*_

### Storage Account

> Create a storage account to hold this state file.

```sh
# manual - prefer not to pipeline\iac this.
az storage account create \
  --name uniquestoragename \
  --resource-group workload-shared-rg \
  --kind StorageV2 \
  --sku Standard_LRS \
  --https-only true \
  --allow-blob-public-access false
```

### Backend Configuration file

```sh
# azure.conf, must be in .gitignore
storage_account_name="uniquestoragename"
container_name="storagecontainername"
key="project.tfstate"
sas_token="?sv=2019-12-12â€¦"
```

### Testing locally

```sh
terraform init -backend-config=azure.conf
```

### Headless

```sh
# Load secrets from Key Vault
variables:
  - group: my-project-awesome-kv

# Initialize with explicitly mapped secrets
steps:
- bash: |
    terraform init \
      -backend-config="storage_account_name=$TF_STATE_BLOB_ACCOUNT_NAME" \
      -backend-config="container_name=$TF_STATE_BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME" \
      -backend-config="key=$TF_STATE_BLOB_FILE" \
      -backend-config="sas_token=$TF_STATE_BLOB_SAS_TOKEN"
  displayName: Terraform Init
  env:
    TF_STATE_BLOB_ACCOUNT_NAME:   $(kv-tf-state-blob-account)
    TF_STATE_BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME: $(kv-tf-state-blob-container)
    TF_STATE_BLOB_FILE:           $(kv-tf-state-blob-file)
    TF_STATE_BLOB_SAS_TOKEN:      $(kv-tf-state-sas-token)
```
